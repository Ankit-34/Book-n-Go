                Gate way of india, Marin drive

            <span>
                <h3>Gate way of india:</h3>
                The Gateway of India is, without doubt, one of the most popular
                tourist hotspots of Mumbai. Sitting proudly on the Apollo Bunder, it
                overlooks the Arabian Sea. It is one of the defining monuments of the
                city of Mumbai and was built in the year 1924. The construction was
                undertaken by the famous architect George Wittet, to commemorate the
                visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. The imposing
                structure of the monument is a beautiful confluence of Indian, Arabic
                and Western architecture and has become a popular tourist hub in the
                city. It is also the starting point of a number of ferry services that
                ply to the historic Elephanta Caves.
            </span>
            <span>
                <h3>Marin drive:</h3>
                Marine Drive is the most easily identifiable landmark associated with
                Mumbai and is indicative of the glamor and glitter of the city. It is
                essentially 3.6 km long, arc-shaped boulevard along the South Mumbai
                coast that starts at the southern end of Nariman Point and ends at
                Girgaum Chowpatty, popularly known as Chowpatty Beach. The coast wraps
                the Arabian sea and is the best place in Mumbai to watch the sunset or
                even to just take a leisurely stroll by the sea any time of the day or
                night. At night, when the whole coastline lights up, it justifies its
                other moniker i.e. Queen's Necklace.
